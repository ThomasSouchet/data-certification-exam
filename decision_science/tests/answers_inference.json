{
    "MEDIAN_AGE": "\n    It seemns that each increase of median_age increases the number of incidents by 2253, holding all others regressors constant.\n    So the median_age is associated woth a positive effect on the number of crimes incidents.\n",
    "T_STAT": "\n    The t-statistics associated with the median age regressor is 1.82. \n    The t-statistic is used in a t-test to determine whether to support or reject the null hypothesis.\n    It is very similar to the Z-score but with the difference that t-statistic is used when the sample size is small.\n    It is computed like this: T = (sample mean - global mean)/sample standard deviation.\n    As the sample size n is not large enough and we don't know the true population Ïƒ, \n    so the Z-score cannot be approximated by a normal distribution and cannot be computed without knowing true population \n    (global standard deviation). So we can use the t-statistic that can be approximated by a Student t-distribution.\n",
    "P_VALUE": "\n    p-value is not very small, bigger than the confidence interval (p-value > 0.05) so we cannot say it is significant.\n    Same for a 90% confidence level (p-value > 0.10)\n",
    "INCREASE": "\n    Holding all others regressors constant, the total number of incidents decrease by 2115 when the share of families \n    with a married couple increases by 1 percentage point in the district.\n",
    "LIMITATIONS": "\n    A very high R-squared can be due to the overfitting of the model. Maybe it is due to outliners in the dataset.\n"
